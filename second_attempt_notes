VLBI - 0.1 - 1 mas resolution

largest exoplanet - ~2 Jupiter radii, 300 pc away, ~3 uas

microlensing for exoplanets ~ 1 uas - 1 mas

labels to add to y-axis

scrapping time for y-axis, replacing with distance in pc

add another x-axis in radians, add another y-axis in km

short lines for telescopes in yellow, add name to left/right, resolution beneath name

Spectra plot

plot each spectrum within main plot (plot within a plot) using log-y scale
