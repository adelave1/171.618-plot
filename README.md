## Kristin, Weichen and Alex (KWA) Angular Resolution Plot

Assignment for 171.618 (Observational Astronomy), in which we create a plot of objects arranged by
the angular resolution required to resolve them (I believe this was the intent of the plot). 

Started 14 September 2016

**First attempt: Starting 14 September 2016**

We agreed to perform the following tasks, which will be checked off upon completion:

* Catalogue (Kristin & Weichen)
    * [x] find size and distance to object (Kristin) - finished 16 September 2016
    * [x] find images (Weichen) - finished 16 September 2016
* plots & code (Alex)
    * [x] develop minimal working example - finished 14 September 2016 (see angular_size_plots.ipynb - sorry about the misnomer!)

I think the plot [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_resolution) (under the 'Specific Cases' section) is rather interesting.
Perhaps we could use it to come up with more ideas...

**Second Attempt: Starting 21 September 2016**

---

* Add time to y-axis
	* [x] vertical lines to indicate resolution that intersect year instrument was introduced
* Populate low angular size area (1uas as to 1mas) of x-axis
	* [x] exoplanets, microlensing, quasars (5 mas), accretion disks
